MRR Quarterly Analysis (2024)
Author: 23f3001275@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

Quarterly MRR growth values: 6.44, 3.69, 5.96, 7.73
Computed Average MRR Growth: 5.96
Industry Target: 15.00

Key findings:
- The computed average MRR growth for 2024 is 5.96%, which is well below the industry benchmark of 15%.
- Q2 is the lowest quarter at 3.69%. Q4 shows improvement but still far from target.

Business implications:
- Current growth trajectory is insufficient to meet industry targets; continued underperformance risks reduced valuation, lower investor confidence, and constrained ability to fund expansion.

Recommendation (solution): expand into new market segments.
- Suggested actions:
  1) Conduct targeted GTM pilots for two high-potential segments (SMB Services, Mid-market FinTech).
  2) Create segment-specific packaging and pricing within 3 months to reduce friction and increase adoption rates.
  3) Invest in targeted marketing + sales enablement with ROI measurement (CPL, conversion) over next two quarters.
  4) Run retention actions to increase existing customer expansion (upsell/cross-sell).

Next steps:
- Build experiments, run pilots, and track MRR uplift. Reassess in two quarters.
