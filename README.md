- Immediate action is required to achieve target growth.

## Recommendation (Solution)
**Primary solution:** expand into new market segments.

Tactical recommendations:
1. Run targeted GTM pilots for 2 new segments (e.g., SMB Services, Mid-market FinTech).
2. Create segment-specific pricing and packaging within 3 months.
3. Increase investment in targeted acquisition channels and enable measurement (CPL, conversion, LTV).
4. Execute retention and expansion programs for existing customers (upsell & cross-sell).
